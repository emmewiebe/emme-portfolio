Hi! 
Assignment 2 was completed via my portfolio. All the Images are not completely accurate yet and all project pages are not included in this assignment as the 3 page minimum was already met.

To run this project;

-go into the correct project folder ( cd emme-portfolio)
-npm install
-npm run dev 

Thank you!




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
